shcache - simple cache object atop ngx.shared.DICT
==================================================

shcache is an attempt at using ngx.shared.DICT with a caching state machine layed on top

it assumes that you're using some slower external lookup (memc, *sql, redis, etc) that you
want to cache the result of, inside your ngx_lua application code.

it aims at :

* being very simple to use from a user perspective
* minimizing the number of external lookup, notably by caching negative lookups and preventing
external lookup stampeded via the usage of locks
* minimizing the amount of serialization / de-serialization to store/load the in cache
* be as fault-tolerant as possible, in case the external lookup fails ( see: cache load stale )


This is based on the lock mechanism devised by Yichun "agentzh" Zhang, and available here:
http://github.com/agentzh/lua-resty-lock

An overview of the state machine is available within this repo, as a graphviz file.


Usage
=====

    local shcache = require("shcache")
    local cmsgpack = require("cmsgpack")

    -- use lua-resty-memcached connector to get data
    local memc = require("memcached")


    local function load_from_cache(key)

        -- closure to perform external lookup to memcache
        local lookup = function ()
            local memc, err = memcached:new()
            if not memc then
                neturn nil, err
            end

            local ok, err = memc:connect("127.0.0.1", 11211)
            if not ok then
                return nil, err
            end

            local value, flags, err = memc:get(key)
            memc:close()

            if not value then
                return nil, err
            end

            -- return data in the form of a table
            return { value = value,
                     flags = flags }
        end

        local my_cache_table = shcache:new(
            ngx.shared.cache_dict
            { external_lookup = lookup,
              encode = cmsgpack.pack,
              decode = cmsgpack.decode,
            },
            { positive_ttl = 10,           -- cache good data for 10s
              negative_ttl = 3,            -- cache failed lookup for 3s
              name = 'my_cache',           -- "named" cache, useful for debug / report
            }
        )

        local my_table, from_cache = my_cache_table:load(key)

        if my_table then
            if from_cache then
                -- cache_status == "HIT" (or "STALE")
                print "cache hit"
            else
                -- cache_status == "MISS"
                print "cache miss (valid data)"
            end
        else
            if from_cache then
                -- cache_status == "HIT_NEGATIVE"
                print "cache hit negative"
            else
                -- cache_status == "NO_DATA"
                print "cache miss (bad data)"
            end
        end

    end


    -- example of logging code on a "named" shcache
    local function log_shcache()
        local shcache_obj = ngx.ctx.shcache['my_cache']

        print shcache_obj.cache_status -- HIT, MISS, HIT_NEGATIVE, STALE or NO_DATA
        print shcache_obj.lock_status  -- NO_LOCK, IMMEDIATE or WAITED
    end



Methods
=======

new
---

`syntax: cache_obj = shcache:new(ngx.shared.DICT, callbacks, opts?)`

Creates an shcache object which implements the caching state machine in the attached documents

`ngx.shared.DICT` is the shared dictionnary (declared in Nginx conf by `lua_shared_dict` directive) to use

`callbacks.external_lookup` is the only required function, it's the closure necessary to lookup data

`callbacks.encode` and `callbacks.decode` are optional (default to identity), if you intend to store a complex
Lua type (tables for instance), they should be declared as ngx.shared.DICT can only store text.

The `opts` table accepts the following options :

* `opts.positive_ttl`
save a valid external loookup for, in seconds
* `opts.positive_ttl`
save a invalid loookup for, in seconds
* `opts.actualize_ttl`
re-actualize a stale record for, in seconds
* `opts.lock_options`
set option to lock see : http://github.com/agentzh/lua-resty-lock for more details.
* `opts.name`
if shcache object is named, it will automatically register itself in ngx.ctx.shcache (useful for logging).
* `opts.locks_shdict`
Name of shared dict to use for locks that has been created using the directive `lua_shared_dict` in your Nginx conf.
defaults to `locks`

load
----

`syntax: data, from_cache = shcache:load(key)`

Use key to load data from cache, if no cache is available `callbacks.external_lookup` will be called

if data is available from cache `callbacks.decode` will be called before returning the data
